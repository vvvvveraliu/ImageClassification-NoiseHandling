# Predictive_Modeling_Image_Classification

## Predictive Modeling for Handling label Noises

### Project Goal 
This project mainly focuses on carrying out model evaluation and selection for predictive analytics on an imbalanced image data. We deal with a classification problem, where the training labels are not perfect, which is a common phenomenon in data science. Getting accurate ground true labels can be costly and time-consuming, and even impossible sometimes. So in this project, we address the issue with imperfect labels. In particular, we are going to train a predictive model where label noises exist.

### Dataset
We worked on a noisy version of "CIFAR-10" dataset. The original CIFAR-10 dataset consists of 32x32 colour images in 10 classes. For this project, random noises have been added to original dataset and we only have access to a small subset of clean labels. In particular, we have a training set with 50,000 images with:
* noisy labels for all images 
* clean labels for the first 10,000 images
