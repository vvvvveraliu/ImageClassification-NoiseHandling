# Predictive_Modeling_Image_Classification

## Predictive Modeling for Image Classification -  label noise and correction

### Project Goal 
This project mainly focuses on carrying out model evaluation and selection for predictive analytics on an imbalanced image data. As data scientists, we often need to 
evaluate different modeling/analysis strategies and decide what is the best. Such decisions need to be supported by sound evidence in the form of model assessment, validation 
and comparison. In addition, we also need to communicate our decision and supporting evidence clearly and convincingly in an accessible fashion.

This project deals with a classification problem, where the training labels are not perfect, which is a common phenomenon in data science. Getting accurate ground true labels
can be costly and time-consuming, and even impossible sometimes. So in this project, we address the issue with imperfect labels. In particular, we are going to train a 
predictive model where label noises exist.
